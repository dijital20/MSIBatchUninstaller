MSIBatchUninstaller
===================

This script, written in AutoIT v3, displays a window with a list of installed programs. Users select one or more programs, select options such as silent and logged, and then uninstall. The uninstaller will uninstall each selected program one at a time.

I created this script back when I was supporting software in a number of configurations, and needed to be able to quickly uninstall a number of programs from a single computer. This code was written some 5 years ago, and has been updated over the years. It may not be the most efficient or robust code, but it does the job admirably.

Please feel free to fork and improve!
